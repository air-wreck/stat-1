\begin{enumerate}
  % Question 1
  % I'll organize all the plots once they're done
  \item The following plots were created:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Stem and leaf plot:
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \caption{Stem and Leaf Plot of Women's Heights (in.)}
          \input{plots/stem.tex}
        \end{figure}
      \item Frequency table:
        \begin{table}[H]
          \centering
          \caption{Frequency Table of Women's Heights (in.)}
          \input{plots/freq.tex}
        \end{table}
      \item Histogram:
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/histogram.pdf}
          \caption{A histogram showing women's heights (in inches)}
        \end{figure}
      \item Pie chart:
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/pie.pdf}
          \caption{A pie chart showing women's heights (in inches)}
        \end{figure}
      \item Box plot:
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/box.pdf}
          \caption{A box plot showing women's heights (in inches)}
        \end{figure}
    \end{enumerate}

  % Question 2
  \item These data were used to compute the following sample summative statistics:
    \begin{table}[H]
      \centering
      \caption{Summative statistics about women's heights (in inches)}
      \input{plots/summative.tex}
    \end{table}

  % Question 3
  \item The data set is not normally distributed; this can be most easily seen from the shape of the histogram, which does not resemble a bell curve. It is not symmetric because it is skewed to the left. I know this because there is a whale tail.
\end{enumerate}
