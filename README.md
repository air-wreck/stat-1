# stat-1
AP Statistics assignment with Rishi Salwi

## building
The master assignment sheet is the LaTeX file `stat.tex`, which compiles to `stat.pdf`. Several figures/tables are automatically generated by Python; these are placed in the `plots/` directory. To compile from scratch, you'll need to:

``` sh
python stat_plot.py  # compile plots as *.pdf graphics
python stat_calc.py > plots/summative.tex  # compile summative statistics table
python stat_stem.py > plots/stem.tex  # compile stem and leaf plot (table)
python stat_freq.py > plots/freq.tex  # compile frequency table
pdflatex -interaction=batchmode stat.tex  # compile final paper
```

Note: `-interaction=batchmode` is just because I find LaTeX's default verbose output to be quite annoying. On Linux (and similar) systems, you can silence it completely by redirecting to `/dev/null`, but then it will appear to hang on errors.

Could this be automated with a Makefile? Yes.

## dependencies
The statistics program just requires Python 2 (with a `scipy` installation). If you want to compile the document, you'll need a LaTeX installation.
